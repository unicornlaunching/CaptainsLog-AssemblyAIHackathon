# Here is the core of the engine we are building
# The core of the engine is built on ChatGPT, the most popular AI tool on the planet
# We are using the OpenAI functionality to create a series of prompts based on a user submitting an audio recording

# Obtain your API key from OpenAI

# Install the openai package
!pip install openai

# Import the openai module and set up the API key
import openai
openai.api_key = "INSERT_API_KEY_HERE"

# Use chatgpt to generate text
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="write the python code compatible with a google colab notebook which invokes openAI's ChatGPT with the da-vinci-003 model",
  max_tokens=1024,
  n=1,
  temperature=0.5,
)

# Print the generated text
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
