My name is Alice Antenyuk and my coach is Zach Zayak. My creed is I give myself permission to make my space a safe space. This report is to outline my plan and the actual events that happened, my performance, how I'm going to improve and what my coach can do to help me move forward.

What I Planned To Do

My plan was to get up early in the morning, work on my course, take a break to exercise and make some art, work on a video, continue to work on the course, take a break for some video games, spend some time with Mike and then go to bed early.

What I Actually Did

I got up early and had a quiet morning to myself. I was able to use the time to meditate and stretch. I had a hot breakfast and practiced my creed. I caught up with some friends and shared about my experience with my battle buddy. I finished the next run of the video and found a fun way to get around the animation. I continued with the course and completed the transfer of all of the labs of the student booklet. I also took a break for yoga and stretching and made some art. I felt a little ill and took some time in bed, made some soup and felt better. I took a break for some shows and then went back to working on the course. Mike was busy, so I turned in early.

My Performance

I am proud of how well I was able to work and how much I wanted to actually work today. I am also proud of reaching out to people and the direction Mike and my communication is going in.

How I'm Going To Improve

Now that these projects are finished, I need to figure out what is next. I need to work on a children's book, help Mike with a pan course and get back to my art supplies. I also need to get back outside and do more to push myself.

What You Can Do As My Coach

I need help from my coach to figure out what to do with my outside problem and help me move forward.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>

The individual in question appears to be struggling with severe depression and anxiety, likely due to a lack of meaningful relationships and a lack of purpose in life. In order to improve their life, the individual should focus on taking three specific actions: 

1. Establish a strong social support system. The individual should seek out positive relationships with friends, family, and/or support groups in order to build a sense of connection and belonging.

2. Engage in meaningful activities. The individual should take up activities that are meaningful to them and that bring purpose to their life. This could include volunteering, taking classes, or pursuing a hobby. 

3. Practice self-care. The individual should prioritize taking care of themselves by getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, and engaging in regular physical activity. Additionally, they should practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, stretching, and mindfulness. 

By taking these three actions, the individual can create a more meaningful and fulfilling life that can help them cope with their depression and anxiety.</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>
